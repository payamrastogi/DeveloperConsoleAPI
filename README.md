Unofficial Google Developer Console API
===================

This is still work in progress.
This is intended to be a Java API for accessing data from Google Play Developer Console.
This has been done in making Andlytics (https://github.com/AndlyticsProject/andlytics), an android app that lets you see stats from Dev Console.
In fact, all the original code is taken straight from Andlytics except with all android dependencies removed.

Todo list:
- [x] Remove all Android dependcies
- [x] Port HTTP client to work with Apache httpclient-4.x
- [x] Get login and app stats fetching to work
- [ ] Cleanup unused functions/classes
- [ ] Write facade to make public API nicer (if necessary)
