Unofficial Google Developer Console API
===================

Work in progress, doesn't do anything.
This is intended to be a Java API for accessing data from Google Play Developer Console.
This has been done in making Andlytics (https://github.com/AndlyticsProject/andlytics), an android app that lets you see stats from Dev Console.
In fact, all the original code is taken straight from Andlytics except with all android dependencies removed.
